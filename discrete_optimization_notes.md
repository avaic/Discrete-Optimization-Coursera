## Week 5 - Linear programming

### What is Linear programming

Linear program is

$\min c_1 \cdot x_1 +\dots + c_n \cdot x_n$
such that

$a_{11}\cdot x_1 + \dots + a_{1n}\cdot x_n\leq b_1$

$\dots$

$a_{m1}\cdot x_1 + \dots + a_{mn}\cdot x_n\leq b_m$

$x_i\geq 0$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$

#### What can we do with Linear programming

We can *maximize*: $\max -(c_1 \cdot x_1 +\dots + c_n \cdot x_n)$;

Variables can take negative values: replace $x_i$ by $x^+_i-x^-_1$;

### Geometry of Linear programming

#### Convexity

The first three sets are convex, the fourth is not.
